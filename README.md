Presentation given on the research I conducted on HIV protein assembly during Summer 2017. During Summer 2017, I helped a grad student at Cal Poly design a plasmid containing a specific HIV protein, HIV-1 Gag. In order to verify that the protein was expressed in yeast, a western blot was performed. During summer 2018, I continued the research with the same grad student and we cloned a plasmid that has the ENV gene with an N-terminal Myc tag after the signal sequence and transformed the plasmid into yeast. The overall objective of this research was to engineer yeast to support HIV-1 assembly.
